# Welcome, this is my first JS Project
I've spent a number of days now (15/06/2023) trying to master git, and now I'll put what I've learned to practice in this first Project getting hands on JavaScript.

It all starts here I guess, so for this project I'll be following along this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqaTKBU9TZk).

I'll try to (maybe) take notes here too, to try to learn mark down along the way.
